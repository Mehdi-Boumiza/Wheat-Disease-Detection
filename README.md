# Wheat Disease Detection

A deep learning system for early detection of wheat diseases using computer vision.

## Status
Currently in development. Working on improving model performance and expanding the dataset with two agriculture professors from INRAT here in Tunisia.

## The Problem
Wheat diseases cause significant crop losses worldwide. Early detection enables farmers to treat infections before they spread, saving both crops and money.

## Approach
This project uses convolutional neural networks to classify wheat diseases from leaf images. The system is built with [Pytorch] and uses transfer learning with [VIT/Efficientnets] as the base architecture.

## Tools
Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy

## Dataset and Models
The full dataset (150GB or about 32K images in total or more) and trained models (1GB+) are available upon request due to file size constraints.

Sample images are included in the /self_test directory.

## Next Steps
* Improve accuracy on yellow rust and septoria.
* Deploy it with the other researchers for farmers to use.

Feel free to reach out if you would like access to the full dataset or trained models.
